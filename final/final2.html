            <h2>My Birth and Childhood</h2>
            <p>I, admittedly, didn’t have the best childhood. I was born artificially in
                a lab made by humans, alongside 3 others, and as such I didn’t really have a mother or father. As a
                result of my artificial birth, I gained human intelligence and lifespan. The 
                humans had always treated me well, and they even offered me many
                resources to help me learn more about the world. Through it, I developed
                a curiosity that couldn’t be sated by mere books. When I turned 18, I bid 
                farewell to my human caretakers, and went out into the world to explore
                its secrets for myself.</p>

            <p>I am now what you would call a nomad or wanderer, exploring this wonderful planet
                at my pleasure, documenting all of the strange and wonderful things I see along the
                way. To list a few places, I’ve been to Machu Picchu, Paris, London, and so many other
                cities.. Maybe one day we’ll meet along the road...assuming you’re the adventurous type!</p>
