            <h2>My Hobbies and Skills</h2>
            <p>Aside from exploring the world, the thing I like to do most is to either read a book about something I’m  interested in , or browse the Internet to research a place where I can go next. I am quite skilled at creating simple  things out of simple materials, such as primitive cameras made out of cardboard, and things like that. Overall, I’m 
                quite a simple person...or bug.</p>
